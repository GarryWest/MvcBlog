                            <p>I worked with Garry for more than 2 years at NextGen on the Inpatient Financial Solution when I was a QA Analyst. 
                            Garry was always willing to help me understand what happens on the "backend"! He spent many hours with me developing 
                            functionality around a project that needed to be released in record time to meet certain government requirements.</p>
                            
                            <p>Garry has a really good understanding of healthcare medical billing/revenue cycle management and EDI requirements. 
                            He was my most valuable resource when I needed to know how the application behaved - we collaborated on most everything! 
                            His work ethic is beyond reproach and I am truly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him.</p>

                            I hired him as a SharePoint Developer but later discovered his versatility as a very capable 
                            and professional .Net and SQL Developer along with his SharePoint Developer skills.</p>
                            <p>He was a joy to work with and was consistently looking for ways to improve customer experiences 
                            via the use of technology. Rarely did I hear from him that he was apprehensive about working on 
                            a new project or task. Instead, he was eager to learn, grow and teach other Developers within 
                            the team about his newly learned skill(s).</p>
